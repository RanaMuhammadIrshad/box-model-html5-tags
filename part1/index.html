              The couple's first stop was Riga, the capital of Latvia. "We had
              been there before and we loved the city; it was affordable, small
              and comfortable," says Nieto Carvajal. On previous visits, they'd
              also made connections at a co-working space called TechHub, which
              made settling in easier. Before long, the couple headed on to
              Berlin, and soon they were hooked on the thrill of exploring a new
              place, and what Nieto Carvajal calls the "freedom" of not being
              tied down.

            My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather
            was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with
            my family!
